version: 0.1.0.0
category: Data
synopsis: QuickCheck tests with portray-diff
description: |
    This provides equality assertion functions for QuickCheck that pretty-print
    structural diffs of the values in question, rather than dumping the entire
    values as part of the counterexamples.  This is useful when comparing very
    large values, since it can otherwise be difficult to tell what changed
    between expected and actual values.
